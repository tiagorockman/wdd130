        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 1988, Rafting Adventures began as a humble rafting outfitter. 
            Over the years, we have grown from a small operation with a single raft to become a leading provider of thrilling river adventures in the region. 
            Our journey has been marked by countless moments of excitement, camaraderie, and exploration as we've guided adventurers through the rapids and scenic wonders of Lower Mississippi River to the Ohio Rivers.
            Despite the challenges and changes over the decades, our commitment to safety, sustainability, and unparalleled customer experiences remains unwavering. 
            Today, as we celebrate over three decades of adventure, we continue to embody the spirit of adventure and discovery that inspired our founders in 1988.
